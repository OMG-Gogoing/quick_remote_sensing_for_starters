# quick_remote_sensing_for_starters
A quick introduction for doing remote sensing with python

As a practitioner of satellite-applications industry in China, I see more and more specific job oppotunities for people who have a background of remote sensing. This is a very good sign. I remember when I finished my master degree of remote sensing in 2017 and went to the job market in China, there was very few specific positions for job seekers who have remote-sensing background. At that time, all I can do is chose to be a assistant in research institutes or took part in civil servant exam. But luckyly, I got a job in a software company(a GIS-based company, also do few remote sensing jobs) as a pre-sale engineer. 6 months later, I changed my job from that company to a commnication-satellite operator, as a sales person. That's a long story, and I'm now too far away from my domain.

No more nonsense!

As what I said at beginning, the specific job oppotunities(most are algorithm engineers) for RSers increase fast in China and most of these jobs get good pay(15k-60k rmb per month). This happend because 1.The smart city plan leads to a boom of smart-city-solution companies in China and more than half of them have intergrated GIS functions into their softwares (GIS is very useful for city manager), 2.Many local governments are aware of the power of RS to extracting the information they need and they desire to see more and more RS based information to be displayed in smart-city softwares.   

Next, let's see how can we get access to these specific jobs. Without exception, all these jobs set Python/Java/C++(programming skill) and Envi/ERDAS(software skill) as entrance ticket. I believe that most of you are very familiar with ENVI, but how about doing remote sensing with codes? 

All I want to share in this channel is the key skills(coding) you need to get an algorithm engineer job in RS industry.

To do this with me, you should:

1) Have a little bit knowledge of RS (not too much, you are an algorithm engineer, not scientist. All you need is to find a effective way to solve the problem).

2) Have a little bit coding skill with python (I can only teach python........).

3) have good understanding of College-level mathematics.



I'll upload the first tutorial on 12th,Nov.

At last, Sorry for my poor English and nonsense........
